# url-shortener

This is my solution to the [URL shortening API landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G).

### The challenge

In this challenge, I integrated the [shrtcode API](https://shrtco.de/) to create shortened URLs and display them like in the designs.

### Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- JavaScript
- [shrtcode API](https://shrtco.de/)

### Live Link
